    Need to track down any users with multiple values for {biopsy, PCaDIAG,
    PCaLocalized} and preserve the older, IFF the newer is just placeholder
    data.

    The source of this comes from interventions failing to check for existing
    values prior to setting defaults, such as "unknown" to avoid initial
    queries.
